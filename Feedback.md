### Feedback

1. Hooks always go at the top of a component
2. File names:
    - `React` component always start with capital letter
    - folder names changed for consistency
3. Would stick to `useReducer` for state management\
    - and use `useEffect` to fetch data on initial load
    - use async functions to persist data and dispach actions after that
4. Use less libraries
    - there import from: `mantine`, `ant` and `tailwind`
    - would eliminate `mantine` and find another way to use the modal
5. Presentation and Readme:
    - Readme should be complete showcasing the application
    - Screenshots and ideally a video showing how to use it and decisions made
